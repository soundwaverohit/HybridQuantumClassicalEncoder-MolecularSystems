# HybridQuantumClassicalEncoder-MolecularSystems


#### TODO
- Look at the correct hamiltonian coefficient changes and where to implement them 
- Have the hamiltonian to find the correct ground state with the correct parameters and the quantum encoder version to find the difference 


## Repo Information
- The classical encoder, quantum circuit, and decoder are outlined in the files
- The learning.py file contains the training loop to run the hybrid model
- The auto_encoder_notebook will contain the pipeline experimentation before the changes are made to the above files


## Proposed packages for pipeline: 
- Qiskit for Quantum Circuits
- Pytorch for the Neural Networks


### Sample output of executor.py is:
