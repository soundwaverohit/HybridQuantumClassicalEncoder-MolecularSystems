# HybridQuantumClassicalEncoder-MolecularSystems


#### TODO
- Get the hamiltonian matrix correct for the water molecule and getting the correct energy values
- Get research insight into why the model is performing well


## Repo Information
- The classical encoder, quantum circuit, and decoder are outlined in the files
- The learning.py file contains the training loop to run the hybrid model
- The auto_encoder_notebook will contain the pipeline experimentation before the changes are made to the above files


## Proposed packages for pipeline: 
- Qiskit for Quantum Circuits
- Pytorch for the Neural Networks


### Sample output of executor.py is:
